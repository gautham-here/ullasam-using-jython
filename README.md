# üéµ Ullasam - Using Jython (JEM)

A creative and technical exploration into **JEM (Jython Environment for Music)**, this project is my attempt to recreate a close instrumental version of a song using the Jython scripting language. The project blends programming and musical interpretation, bridging the gap between technology and art. This is my first try at using Jython, so comments are welcome and much appreciated!!

This effort is both a tribute to the original creators and an educational exercise in algorithmic music generation.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

This project utilizes **JEM (Jython Environment for Music)**, a powerful environment that enables musical composition using Python-like syntax through Jython.

### üì¶ Prerequisites

- Java and Python installed on your system
- Download the [JEM Environment](https://jythonmusic.me/download/)  
  (Extract the files and launch the application from there)

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Project

1. Open the `JEM` application.
2. Load the file `ullasam.py` into the editor.
3. Run the script from within the JEM interface.
4. A `.mid` (MIDI) file will be automatically generated in the folder where the application resides.

### üéß Converting the Output

The output file is in MIDI format. To convert it into a playable audio format such as `.wav`, use any MIDI-to-Audio tool.  

**Recommended Tool**: [Timidity++](http://timidity.sourceforge.net/)

Both the `.mid` and the converted `.wav` versions are included in this repository for quick access and listening.

## üí° Project Goals

- Showcase how **music can be coded** using JEM and Python principles.
- Provide a bridge for those in music to explore programming, and vice versa.
- Inspire cross-domain creativity by recreating one of my beloved compositions in a novel way.
